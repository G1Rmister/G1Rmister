## 🔐 What I Build

I'm a blockchain developer specializing in **smart contract security** and **full-stack Web3 applications**. My work focuses on understanding vulnerabilities to build more secure protocols.

### Current Focus Areas

- **Security Research**: Studying smart contract exploits and attack vectors
- **Protocol Development**: Building secure DeFi primitives and NFT systems
- **Audit Tooling**: Creating frameworks for safer development workflows
- **Web3 Integration**: Connecting secure contracts with intuitive frontends

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Smart Contracts & Security**
- Solidity with Foundry framework
- Security analysis and exploit research
- Custom development environments for safe testing

**Full-Stack Web3**
- Next.js for decentralized applications
- Wagmi for Ethereum interactions
- Node.js backend services
- JavaScript/TypeScript across the stack

## 🎯 Philosophy

```
Security is not a feature—it's the foundation.
```

Every line of code is a potential attack vector. My approach combines:
- Deep understanding of common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, access control, oracle manipulation)
- Rigorous testing with Foundry's fuzzing and invariant testing
- Clean, auditable code that prioritizes safety over cleverness
- Continuous learning from past exploits and emerging attack patterns
